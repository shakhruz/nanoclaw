# Unified Client Profile Builder

Merge all collected intelligence about a client (Instagram, Website, YouTube) into a single comprehensive profile. This profile becomes the foundation for funnel strategy and the main reference document when working with this client.

## Trigger

When user asks to:
- "создай профиль клиента", "build client profile"
- "объедини данные по клиенту"
- "client profile @username"
- After completing analyses on multiple platforms

## Data Sources

Scan for all available data about the client:

```bash
USERNAME="<username>"
echo "=== Instagram ===" && ls /workspace/group/wiki/entities/$USERNAME.md 2>/dev/null && echo "OK" || echo "MISSING"
echo "=== Instagram Audit ===" && ls /workspace/group/wiki/entities/$USERNAME-audit.md 2>/dev/null && echo "OK" || echo "MISSING"
echo "=== Website ===" && ls /workspace/group/wiki/entities/*domain*.md 2>/dev/null && echo "OK" || echo "MISSING"
echo "=== YouTube ===" && ls /workspace/group/youtube-analysis/*/channel-summary.json 2>/dev/null && echo "OK" || echo "MISSING"
echo "=== Okto Summary ===" && ls /workspace/group/instagram-analysis/$USERNAME/okto-summary.json 2>/dev/null && echo "OK" || echo "MISSING"
echo "=== Media Catalog ===" && ls /workspace/group/wiki/media/instagram/$USERNAME/catalog.md 2>/dev/null && echo "OK" || echo "MISSING"
```

If key data is missing → suggest: "Нет данных по YouTube. Запустить анализ канала?"

Read ALL available sources before synthesizing.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Collect & Read All Sources

Read every available file:
- `wiki/entities/<username>.md` — Instagram profile analysis
- `wiki/entities/<username>-audit.md` — marketing audit
- `wiki/entities/<domain>.md` — website analysis
- `wiki/entities/<youtube-channel>.md` — YouTube analysis
- `instagram-analysis/<username>/okto-summary.json` — structured IG data
- `website-analysis/<domain>/site-analysis.json` — structured website data
- `youtube-analysis/<channel>/channel-summary.json` — structured YT data
- `wiki/media/instagram/<username>/catalog.md` — photo catalog
- `wiki/media/youtube/<channel>/catalog.md` — video thumbnails
- `wiki/media/website/<domain>/catalog.md` — website screenshots

### Phase 2: Cross-Reference & Deduplicate

Merge data intelligently:
- **Services:** combine from IG bio + website services page + YT video topics. Deduplicate.
- **Pricing:** website prices are most reliable, IG posts second, YT mentions third.
- **Audience:** IG comments + YT comments + website testimonials → unified audience portrait.
- **Visual brand:** IG palette + website palette → find common colors = true brand colors.
- **Tone/language:** compare IG captions vs YT speech vs website copy → identify consistent voice.
- **Content assets:** merge photo catalog + video catalog + website screenshots.

### Phase 3: Generate Unified Profile

**File:** `wiki/entities/client-<name>.md`

```yaml
---
title: "Client Profile — <Name>"
type: entity
subtype: client-profile
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
sources_analyzed:
  instagram: "@<username>"
  website: "<domain>"
  youtube: "@<channel>"
related: ["[[entities/<username>]]", "[[entities/<domain>]]", "[[entities/<channel>]]"]
tags: [client-profile, okto, sales-funnel]
confidence: high

### Phase 4: Generate client-profile.json

Save machine-readable version:

```bash
cat > /workspace/group/client-profiles/<name>/profile.json << 'EOF'
{
  "clientName": "", "niche": "", "geography": "", "languages": [],
  "platforms": {"instagram":"","website":"","youtube":""},
  "services": [{"name":"","price":"","source":"","description":""}],

    "testimonials":[], "screenshots":[], "transcripts":[]
  },
  "funnelReadiness": "high|medium|low",
  "quickWinFunnel": "",

EOF
```

### Phase 5: Save & Report

- Update wiki index + log: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | Client profile: <Name>`
- Cross-link all related entity pages
- Git commit
- Send summary to user with key highlights and readiness assessment

## Re-profiling

If profile already exists → READ existing, MERGE new data, note changes:
"Обновление профиля: добавлены данные YouTube, обнаружена новая услуга..."

## Cost

Zero API cost — reads existing data only.
